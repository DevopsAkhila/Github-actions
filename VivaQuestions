Part 3: Exam / Viva Q&A (READY TO MEMORIZE)
Q1. How do you enforce manual approval in GitHub Actions?

A: By assigning a job to a protected environment with required reviewers.

Q2. How are secrets protected in GitHub Actions?

A: Secrets are encrypted at rest and masked (***) in logs.

Q3. What happens if one matrix job fails?

A: Other matrix jobs continue, but downstream jobs are skipped.

Q4. How do you conditionally deploy based on branch?

A: Using if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/<branch>'.

Q5. Can Slack approvals replace GitHub approvals?

A: No. Slack is for notification only; approvals are enforced by GitHub environments.

Q6. Difference between Jenkins input and GitHub environment approval?

A: Jenkins approvals are code-defined; GitHub approvals are policy-defined in UI.

Q7. Why is environment-based approval safer?

A: It cannot be removed accidentally from code.

Q8. Where are secrets injected at runtime?

A: Via environment variables using ${{ secrets.NAME }}.

Q9. What happens if environment is removed?

A: Approval gate is bypassed (dangerous).

Q10. Real-world deployment flow?

A:
develop → dev → main → staging → approval → production
