Advanced GitHub Actions Lab Exercises
These exercises are designed for users with basic GitHub Actions knowledge (e.g., simple CI workflows). They focus on advanced concepts like matrix strategies, caching, artifacts, conditional deployments, secrets, and reusable workflows. Each exercise assumes you have a GitHub repository set up (create one if needed, e.g., advanced-actions-lab). You'll push files to it and trigger workflows via pushes or pull requests.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:

A GitHub account and repository.
Basic YAML familiarity.
For Exercise 3, a free Vercel account (for deployment simulation; no real secrets needed beyond API tokens).
Clone your repo locally, add files, commit, and push to trigger workflows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test workflows in the "Actions" tab of your repo. Debug using workflow logs.
